* Making templates
* Game/service interaction
* Testing the roughly finished project locally
* Deploying the finished project to Heroku
* Final submission (DL: 19.2.2018 midnight)

Some steps are possible to be interactive. During the implementation phase (Step 2-6), appropriate testing will be done after finishing each step.

#### 5.2 Schedule
* 16 Dec-21 Dec: Researching the topic, Collecting materials and Making the project plan.
* 22 Dec-9 Jan: Realizing the function Authentication. And design of models is accomplished or towards the end.
